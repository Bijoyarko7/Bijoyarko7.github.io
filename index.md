## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech, advised by [Prof. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at [Gilead Sciences](https://www.gilead.com/) as AI Scientist Intern. Before that, I completed my MS in Operationrs Research at Virginia Tech, and obtained my Bachelors in Industrial Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/).

## Research Interests
My primary research interests revolve around AI for Science and engineering. Most of my works fall into one these categories:

- **Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics**, with a focus on uncovering mathematical expressions behind data (Neural Symbolic Regression)
- **Deep Learning for Code Generation**, with a focus on code translation and program synthesis
<!-- - **Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting**, with a focus on exploring GNN and ODE forecasting methods -->

<!-- ## News
