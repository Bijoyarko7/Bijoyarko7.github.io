## Biography

Hi! Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. [Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at [Gilead Sciences](https://www.gilead.com/) as Data Science Intern. I completed my MS in Operations Research and Optimization at Virginia Tech, and obtained my BS in Industrial Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/).

## Research Interests
My primary research interests revolve around AI for Science and Engineering. Most of my works fall into one of these categories:
<!-- Most of my works focus on extending Reinforcement Learning and Transformer models to non-text domains, falling into one of these categories: -->

- **Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics**, with a focus on uncovering mathematical expressions behind data (Neural Symbolic Regression)
- **Deep Learning for Code**, with a focus on program synthesis and code translation
- **Deep Learning for Time Series**, with a focus on sensor data fusion and forecasting
<!-- - **Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting**, with a focus on exploring GNN and ODE forecasting methods -->

## News
- **[Sep. 2023]** One paper accepted to NeurIPS 2023.
- **[Jun. 2023]** Two papers accepted to TMLR 2023.
<!-- - **[Apr. 2019]** One paper was accepted to TMLR 2023. -->
